After Copying Template Project directory And Files As A Whole To Some Another Directory,
========================================================================================
[ 
  In VMWare based Windows10 VM, it seems that device connection to VM through Mac may fail 
  if device is not connected to internet. 
  So keep device connected to internet.
]

01) Go To The Respective Directory Where Template Directory And File Structure Resides.
    Select All And Copy/Paste To Desired Directory ( Around 9 Contents : 3 Directories + 6 Files ).
    [ '.gradle' directory may get regenerated everytime when built. So keep it or delete it everytime ]

    Eg : Suppose our template directory is '_Template' having the directory structure that we want.
         Suppose now we are going to use it to create window in portrait mode.
         Then first create a new directory, say '00-Winow-Portrait' and copy all contents from
         '_Template' directory ( not the '_Template' directory itself ) to '00-Window-Portrait' 
         directory.

02) First Go To app/src/main, Open AndroidManifest.xml And Change Last Component Of 'package'
    Attribute As Needed.

    Eg : Suppose right now the 'package' attribute is showing 'com.astromedicomp.window',
         now we are going to create window in portrait mode, then change the last component 'window'
         to something 'win_portrait' so that it looks 'com.astromedicomp.win_portrait'

03) Then Go Inside app/src/main/java Directory And Reflect Same Above Change In directory Name
    Of The Last Component.

    Eg : Suppose due to package attribute 'com.astromedicomp.window', the directory structure of 'app'
         directory is app/src/main/java/com/astromedicomp/window, where the last 3 subdirectories
         match with the 3 components in package attribute.
         Now in step 02 we changed our package attribute to 'com.astromedicomp.win_portrait', 
         so to reflect this in above subdirectories, change the name of last subdirectory 
         'window' to 'win_portrait'.
         Means now the final directory structure of 'app' directory should look like :
         app/src/main/java/com/astromedicomp/win_portrait, where the last 3 subdirectories match with 
         the 3 components in new package attribute.

04) Then Go Inside That final directory say 'win_portrait' and change 1st 'package' Statement in Every 
     .java File to reflect same above change.

    Eg : Suppose right now the 'MainActivity.java' file's first 'package' ststement looks like :

         package com.astromedicomp.window;

         To reflect the new chage in apackage attribute, change this line to :

         package com.astromedicomp.win_portrait;

         * Do this in all .java files and other relevant files as needed.

05) Finally and OPTIONALLY go to app/src/main/res/values directory, edit strings.xml and change 
    project's display name that will appear on device.

    Eg : This is the name that user/we will see on the device when this app will be deploied.
         Suppose previous app's name on this device was saying 'Window', you now can change it
         to say : 'Portrait-Window'

06) From here onwards, follow the steps 10 to 14 in '06-Steps For Android Project-CommandLine.txt' 
    file to build, deploy and debug this new app.
